# Clojure web application

This repo contains a sample web application and accompanying bits needed to build and deploy it (or any other Clojure web app) using
[jclouds](http://code.google.com/p/jclouds/), [pallet](http://github.com/hugoduncan/pallet), and [Hudson](http://hudson-ci.org/),
as I described at a high level in my talk at the [first Clojure Conj](http://first.clojure-conj.org/speakers#emerick)
in October, 2010.

An accompanying screencast and slides from that talk are available
[here](http://cemerick.com/2010/11/02/continuous-deployment-of-clojure-web-applications). 

A slight disclaimer: what is contained herein and discussed in the screencast is by no means an *ideal* web application
deployment process.  It is only meant to be an easy-to-understand first step into using pallet, jclouds, and Hudson.
You are strongly encouraged to learn about these tools and customize (or likely replace) this basic approach
for your own needs.
